# Titanic_Classification
## Titanic passenger survival Prediction using Logistic Regression


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the code and experiments, you'll need the following:

  - Python (version 3.6 or later)
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:   
 ```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Installation
To get started, follow these steps:   
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyas-rp/Titanic_Classification.git
```
  2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Titanic_Classification
```
  3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file:
```bash
jupyter notebook Titanic_Classification__.ipynb
```
## Procedure 
1. **Data Loading: Load Titanic dataset from 'train.csv', including survival status.

2. **Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, drop 'Cabin', convert 'Age' and 'Embarked', and encode categorical features.

3. **Data Visualization: Create count plots using seaborn to understand data distribution and feature relationships.

4. **Data Splitting: Divide data into features and target labels, then split into training and testing sets.

5. **Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model using training data.

6. **Model Evaluation: Make predictions on training and testing sets, calculate accuracy scores for evaluation.

# Results
  - he Jupyter Notebook shows the analysis, visualizations, and evaluation of the Titanic survivor prediction model. You can enhance the model's accuracy by trying 
    various features, preprocessing methods, and model parameters.
    
  - Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters and model architectures to improve accuracy.
